Python break statement. It terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement,
just like the traditional break statement in C. The most common use for break is when some external condition is triggered
requiring a hasty exit from a loop. The break statement can be used in both while and for loops.

        for var in sequence:
            #codes inside for loop
            if condition:
  |<------------break
  |         # codes inside for loop
  |-->#codes outside for loop


         while test expression:
            #codes inside while loop
            if condition:
|<---------------break
|           # codes inside while loop
|----> #codes outside while loop
