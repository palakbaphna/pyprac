The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes FALSE.
You must use caution when using while loops because of the possibility that
this condition never resolves to a FALSE value. This results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called an infinite loop.

An infinite loop might be useful in client/server programming where the server needs to run continuously so that client programs
can communicate with it as and when required.
