#To iterate over a decreasing sequence, we can use an extended form of range() with three arguments - range(start_value, end_value, step).
# When omitted, the step is implicitly equal to 1.
# However, can be any non-zero value. The loop always includes start_value and excludes end_value during iteration:


for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i)
