#the Python for loop is an iterator based for loop. It steps through the items of lists, tuples, strings,
#the keys of dictionaries and other iterables. Python for loop starts with the keyword "for" followed
#by an arbitrary variable name, which will hold the values of the following sequence object, which is stepped through.

#for <variable> in <sequence>:
#	<statements>
#else:
#	<statements>

# Eaxmple 1
